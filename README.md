# Description of the problem
For the purposes of this challenge, assume the words can be arbitrarily long UTF8 strings.

Requirements:
1) Implement "PUT" HTTP endpoint which will save/replace file on the disk.
2) Implement "GET "HTTP endpoint which will return a "processed" file without word duplicates.
3) Order of the input/output can be ignored.
4) Assume you cannot hold the entire file in memory.

Priority: Normal
Estimation: __SP

Acceptance criteria:
We will look into:
Code quality
Performance, complexity
There are no limitations to tools/programming language usage.
You're free to use any framework, but we'd like to see a short explanation of your decision. It will be good to have a short note on why the specific architecture approach was chosen.
The working code is covered with tests code. There is no need to cover the codebase for 100% with tests, but the key parts should be covered so we can run them. Also, instrumented tests can be skipped.
The solution should be shared using any VCS hosting.

# Approach
